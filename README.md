# fileApi
Make sure you clone the directory on your localhost to run the program successfully.
Run the file index.php on your broswer, and drag n drop the plugins from the plugins folder to add them into dom.
Once added the plugins will be uploaded in the upload folder and thus accessible everytime.
Feel free to make your own plugin and add them. This is not the final version of the fileApi and more functions will be added soon.
Happy Coding!
